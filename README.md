# BNTA Capstone Project - Horror-scopes

## Objective:

Create a website that displays spooky horroscope information.

## Backend:

The backend contains a database of zodiac description pages, monthly horrorscopes for each zodiac and an email service.

The email service allows users to submit their email and zodiac into a form and they will be sent an email with predictions based on the month and zodiac.

## Frontend:

In this project we really wanted to get a handle on css and REACT and so have tried out several different methods including React Redux, React Router, Modals and an animated wheel of icons that can be used for navigation. We also added media queries to have the site be mobile responsive.

## Future Additions:

Currently there is no way in the frontend to add horrorscopes to the database or change the description. If we had had more time we would have added an admin page which you could add to the page.
